# Bayesian Homework: Q1, Q2, Q3

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that answers a three-part Bayesian homework assignment:

- **Q1:** Implementation of a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler for a location-scale t model.
- **Q2:** Exploration of the impact of sample size on inference for the degrees of freedom parameter \(\nu\) using PyMC.
- **Q3:** A detailed derivation of the posterior predictive distribution by integrating out a latent variable, showing that the result is the standard Student-\(t\) density, along with an explanation of its relevance.

## File Structure
- **Notebook:** Contains clearly delineated markdown and code cells for Q1, Q2, and Q3. Each section includes:
  - A brief written explanation of the approach.
  - Step-by-step code implementations.
  - Renderable plots and diagnostic images.
- **README.md:** This file.

## Instructions
- Review the markdown cells for detailed explanations and the code cells for implementations and diagnostics.

## Author
- This notebook was prepared by Yuanting Han.
